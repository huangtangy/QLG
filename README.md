### This code folder provides numerical simulations of quantum lattice gate (QLG)–based state preparation.
Note: The recommended Python environment is specified in `requirements.txt`.
There are two methods included in the Repos:
(1). Adiabatic ramping 
For more details about the methodology and analytical expressions, see Ref. https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-025-02354-0 or the arXiv preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17069.

(2) Single-period Floquet control.
See more details about in Ref: arXiv preprint: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17069.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08782).
